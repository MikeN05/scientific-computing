My repository contains two folders;Python basics and scientific computing;For python basics;
This folder contains three files; datatypes.py,functions.py and structures.py
The scientific computing folder contains the start.py file
To run these files,write the command python(filename).py

From this excersice i have learnt how to create a repository and pushing it to github.
